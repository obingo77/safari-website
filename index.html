Late in the afternoon, all kinds of animals flock to the lakes and to drink, and you may even be lucky enough to witness elephants bathing in the cool water.
                 On the tour, your guide will attempt to spot as many animals as possible, and will almost certainly try to find antelopes – because where there are antelopes, there are sure to be predators.</p>
